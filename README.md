🔷 Description:

I developed an AI-based Driver Drowsiness Detection System using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.

This system monitors the driver's eye movements in real-time using facial landmark detection and calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect prolonged eye closure.

If the driver’s eyes remain closed for a specific number of frames, the system:

Displays a visual warning on the screen

Triggers a voice alert message to prevent potential accidents

The voice alert is intelligently designed to activate each time drowsiness is detected and reset once the driver opens their eyes.

🔹 Technologies Used:

Python

OpenCV

MediaPipe Face Mesh

NumPy

pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)

Multithreading

This project demonstrates real-time computer vision, facial landmark analysis, and practical AI safety implementation for road accident prevention.
